```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_organization_id ON payments(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_customer_id ON payments(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_invoice_id ON payments(invoice_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_transaction_id ON payments(transaction_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_payment_date ON payments(payment_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_payment_method ON payments(payment_method);
```

## Reconciliation Algorithm

### Matching Criteria and Scoring
1. **Exact Amount Match** (40% confidence): Payment and transaction amounts match exactly
2. **Date Proximity** (30% confidence): Same day = 30%, within 3 days = 20%
3. **Reference Match** (30% confidence): Exact = 30%, partial = 15%
4. **External ID Match** (20% confidence): Payment reference matches transaction external ID
5. **Phone Number Match** (25% confidence): Customer phone matches counterparty number
6. **Name Similarity** (20% confidence): Customer name similarity with counterparty name
7. **Payment Method Consistency** (10% confidence): Mobile money payment with deposit transaction

### Confidence Levels
- **High (90%+)**: Automatic reconciliation recommended
- **Medium (70-89%)**: Manual review suggested
- **Low (50-69%)**: Possible match, requires verification
- **Very Low (<50%)**: Unlikely match, not displayed
